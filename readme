RGB LED Controller 🟩🟥🟦🟨 📱💻🛜

Welcome to my first IoT project! 🚀 This project is a Flutter app designed to control an RGB LED strip.
You might be thinking, "Why not just buy a ready-made LED strip with an app included?"
Well, as a developer, I’m curious by nature, and I thought:

"What if I try to build my own app?"
So, I embarked on a journey of learning, coding, and creating. Here's how it all came together:

🌟 Features

🖍 Custom LED colors: Control the LED strip with your chosen color.
🌈 Animations: Includes effects like a rainbow animation (or aurora).
📱 Cross-platform app: Built for both desktop (status bar app) and mobile using Flutter.
🛜 IoT communication: Uses MQTT protocol for efficient real-time updates.
⚙️ How It Works

1. Hardware Setup
I chose the ESP32 microcontroller for its built-in WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities.
Wrote code to control the LED strip and added features like animations.
2. Flutter App
Developed a cross-platform Flutter app to control the LEDs.
Created a status bar app because I spend most of my time on my laptop.
3. Server Setup
Built a Node.js server (later migrated to TypeScript) with WebSocket communication for real-time updates.
Upgraded to MQTT protocol for better performance.
🖥️ Infrastructure

To deploy the server, I converted an old laptop into a personal server running Ubuntu Server:

Configured a domain via GoDaddy.
Used DuckDNS to handle my dynamic IP issues with a cron job to update the IP automatically.
🔧 Refactoring & Automation

I constantly improved the codebase and processes:

✅ Migrated from BLoC to a better state management approach.
✅ Implemented GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
✅ Automated TestFlight deployments using Fastlane.
✅ Switched from WebSocket to MQTT protocol for efficient IoT communication.

💡 What I Learned

This project was not just about controlling an LED strip—it was about exploring hardware, software, and infrastructure. It taught me about:

Microcontrollers like the ESP32.
Building scalable apps with Flutter.
Creating and deploying personal servers.
Handling dynamic IPs and domain configuration.
🚀 Future Plans

Add more animations and customization options.
Explore integrating voice control.
Deploy to a cloud service for scalability.
